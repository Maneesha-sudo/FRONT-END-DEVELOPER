✅ React Todo Application

A simple and functional Todo Application built using React, focused on demonstrating core frontend concepts such as state management, component architecture, and user interaction.

This project is part of my Frontend Developer portfolio and is designed to reflect patterns commonly discussed in technical interviews.

📌 Project Overview

This Todo application allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently.
It follows a component-based architecture and uses React hooks to handle state and side effects.

The project emphasizes clean code, reusability, and real-world CRUD logic.

🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks

✏️ Edit existing tasks

❌ Delete tasks

✅ Mark tasks as completed

🔍 Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)

💾 Persist tasks using browser localStorage

🌗 Dark / Light mode toggle

📱 Responsive and clean UI

✅ All features listed above are implemented in the code.

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

React Functional Components

useState for state and UI management

useEffect for handling side effects (localStorage)

Controlled form inputs

Conditional rendering

Array methods (map, filter, sort)

Lifting state up and prop-based communication

Reusable and maintainable component structure

🧩 Component Structure

App – Manages global state (tasks, filter, theme)

TodoInput – Handles task creation

TodoList – Filters, sorts, and displays tasks

TodoItem – Manages individual task actions (edit, delete, complete)

Filter – Filters tasks based on status

DarkModeToggle – Toggles dark and light theme

This separation improves readability and scalability.
